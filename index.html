        <p>I'm Srishti Mahitha! My favourite hobby is to read books, in the fantasy and myth genre. I like fantasy and myth books as they let your imagination run wild and not based on real life. I also like reading adventure books of any genre. Other than books, I like writing too. I LOVE writing books so much and you guessed it, in the fantasy genre.like I said, I love fantasy as it lets your imagination go free. and there are no specific rules to follow for writing in this genre. And the next hobby is drawing and art! I love doing digital art as you get the exact color you want and you can customize the brushes too! and your drawing never gets lost while on a paper you may misplace it. While on the other hand, I like traditional art or the art you draw with your hand as you don't need any gadgets to draw. and your hand is more free to roam around. </p>

  <p>this is one of my favourite books! it is called Cliffhanger! in this story, there is a boy named Tim, who is forced to go to an adventure center. He takes his teddy bear named Walter Bear but forgets it in his car. Then he meets a plump boy named Biscuits and a mean, lean boy named Giles. They first go abeseiling, then canoeing and many more adventures. At first tim didn't like the place but then at the end he LOVED the place so much.</p>
